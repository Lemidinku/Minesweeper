# Minesweeper Game

This is a Minesweeper game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The idea for this project was inspired by a LeetCode problem.(https://leetcode.com/problems/minesweeper/description/)
While working on this project, I learned about working with sounds and time. 
The game logic uses the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm of graph traversal.
